# Podium Challenge - Shakespeare Front End

## Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to review this project, I had quite a bit of fun making it, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with you.

I built this project with React and styled it with Styled-Components.

## Viewing Options

There are two ways to view my site.

1. Running Locally
   - Download the folder & navigate to the folder
   - run `yarn add react` in your terminal
   - followed by `yarn install` to add dependencies
   - then run `yarn start` to launch the local server
2. Viewing on Server
   - To make it a bit simpler - I've hosted the code on Netlify
   - The live version can be viewed here: [Podium Challenge Live](https://podium-challenge.netlify.com/)
